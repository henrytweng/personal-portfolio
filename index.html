        <p>
            I'm a Data Analytics student at <a href="https://qcsociology.org">Queen's College</a>. I am learning how to wrangle data with good code and analyzing it with even better writing.
        </p>

        <p>
            I like to present clear analysis of available data. My goal is to do this where I can impact policy and social justice.
