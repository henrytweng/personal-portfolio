        <p>
            I am an undergraduate at Queen's College majoring in <a href="https://qcsociology.org">Sociology</a> with minors in Computer Science and Psychology. I am learning to wrangle data in a variety of formats and analyze it to extract useful insights.

            I am passionate about social science research.
